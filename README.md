# `strove`

This is a [Remix](https://remix.run/) project built upon:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) for style composition
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for refactoring with confidence
- [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), enforced through [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for consistency and clean diffs

Auto-fixes are performed on save with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or by using `npm run fix`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/routes/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
